>>> mango :)

couple things that need doing.
[DONE] - ui values wrapped in rc<refcell>
- wrap store get/put interactions
	- should state own the store? (yes)
> - actually meaningful menu options
	- > have anything move around
		- > entity system... which?
		- > xforms in value store?
		- idea: play with boids
- layout: multiple menu displays
- in-engine display of perf metrics
	- metrics measurements trackers
	- some ways of visualizing that
- pretty up the rendering (eternal...)

- i don't like how values are tracked
[DONE] - hashmap instead of vec
