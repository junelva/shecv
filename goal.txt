>>> coffee :)

couple things that need doing.
[DONE] - ui values wrapped in rc<refcell>
- in-engine display of perf metrics
	- sidequest: multiple menu displays
	- metrics measurements trackers
	- some ways of visualizing that
- pretty up the rendering (eternal...)

- i don't like how values are tracked
[DONE] - hashmap instead of vec
